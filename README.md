# launcher
A game client and launcher in Electron made with React.

## Setup
Install node/io.js. Open a terminal / command prompt, and then type
`npm install -g gulp`.

Change into the root of the project folder (`cd pathtolauncher`), and then run
`npm install`.

Change into "app" (`cd app`), and then run `npm install` again.

Now run `gulp`, and Electron should start. Happy testing / developing!
